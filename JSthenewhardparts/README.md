# JavaScript: The New Hard Parts

Understanding of the new features of JavaScript in ES6+:

- how promises are implemented under-the-hood to truly help fix the challenge of inversion of control in asynchronous code design
- use iterators and generators to master asynchronous control flow
- solve complex async challenges by using the call stack, event loop, callback queue, micro-task queue and browser APIs so that you can navigate complex asynchronous problems

Hands-on programming challenges, the instructions are in the urls herebelow
